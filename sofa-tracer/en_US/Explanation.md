Terminology | Description
---- | ---
TraceId | TraceId refers to the ID that represents the unique request in SOFATracer. This ID is generally generated by the first system in the cluster that processes the request and is passed over the network to the next requested system in distributed calls.
SpanId | SpanId represents the location or level of the request in the entire call link. For example, the system A calls system B, C, and D in sequence when processing a request. Then the SpanId of the three calls are respectively: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3. If system B continues to call system E and F, the SpanIds of the two calls are: 0.1.1, 0.1.2.
